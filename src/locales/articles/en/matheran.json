The heritage toy train, a narrow-gauge railway that has been chugging through scenic tunnels and verdant valleys since 1907, offers breathtaking views of the Sahyadri mountains. This UNESCO World Heritage route is a photographer's paradise, with each turn revealing new vistas of misty peaks and lush greenery."
